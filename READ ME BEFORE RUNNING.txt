Follow these steps! They only have to be done once.

This script requires the SYSINTERNAL tool 'Strings' (Included in folder) and your own VirusTotal API key which is free once you sign up here:

https://www.virustotal.com/gui/join-us

Please ensure the strings exe is inserted into the system32 folder, Located at C:\Windows\System32

Note - Run strings from within system32 by double clicking the application. You have to accept the terms and conditions before it can
be ran and used by this powershell script.

VirusTotal: You will require your own API key which you can get for free by signing up to VirusTotal, located within the API V3 resources.
Insert your own API key on line 88, removing the ##YOUR API KEY##, including the # chars.

This is only version 1 of the script. Code will be refined and more features will be added in the future.

If this code is distributed I take no responsbility for the 'highly unlikely' potential damage caused by running it. This script only writes 
to custom txt files which act as logs, while the rest are extracted using read only when gathering crucial data for analysis.

Enjoy!!!!

Making tedious tasks easier, 1 line at a time :)
